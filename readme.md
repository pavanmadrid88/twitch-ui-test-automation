# Sporty Group – Twitch UI Automation Assignment

This repository contains automated test scripts developed as part of the QA assignment.  
The tests are written using **Pytest** and **Playwright**.

## Setup & Execution

### 1. Clone repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavanmadrid88/twitch-ui-test-automation.git
cd twitch-ui-test-automation
```

### 2. Install dependencies
- Make sure python is available in the system
```bash
python --version
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run all tests
```bash
pytest -n auto --html=artifcats/report.html --self-contained-html
```
- -n auto → Runs tests in parallel using all available CPU cores (via pytest-xdist).
- --html=artifacts/report.html → Generates an HTML test report named report.html under artifacts directory.
- --self-contained-html → Embeds all CSS and JS into the report so it’s fully standalone
- If you don’t specify any arguments when running pytest, the default options defined in the pytest.ini file will be used.

### 4. Generate HTML report
After test execution, the HTML report will be automatically generated in the **artifacts** directory.

## Notes
- The framework uses **Pytest** as test runner and **Playwright** for browser automation.
- **conftest.py** — provides Playwright pytest fixtures (pw, browser, context, page), CLI options (--device, --headless),
  logging fixture, and a failure hook that captures/attaches screenshots to pytest-html report file.
- Page Object Model design pattern is followed in the framework.
- **BasePage** class encapsulates common browser actions such as clicking, typing, waiting for elements, and navigation.
- Each individual page (e.g., HomePage, StreamerPage etc) inherits from **BasePage**, ensuring code re-usability and 
  consistency across tests.
- Under utils directory -> **ui_test_utils.py** includes a **get_logger()** helper for consistent logging across tests
  and can be extended with additional UI utilities.
- Logs are stored in **/logs/** directory.
- **HTML report** & all **screenshots** captured during test execution are stored under the **artifacts** directory.
